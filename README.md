# House-Price-Detection

Overview: 

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a machine learning model. Accurate 
prediction of house prices is a crucial task in the real estate market, which helps stakeholders make 
informed decisions. This project leverages various data preprocessing techniques and machine 
learning models to predict house prices based on historical and current market data. 


Objectives: 

- To clean and preprocess a dataset containing house price information.
- To explore and visualize the relationships between different features and house prices.
- To build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting house prices.
- To analyze the importance of different features in predicting house prices.

Results: 

The project successfully builds a predictive model for house prices. Key outcomes include: 
- An accurate prediction model that can estimate house prices based on the provided features.
- Insights into which features are most important for predicting house prices.
- Visualizations that help understand the data and the model's performance. 

Conclusion: 

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting house prices. Through 
data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, we achieve a robust predictive model. 
The analysis highlights the importance of various features in determining house prices, providing 
valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.
